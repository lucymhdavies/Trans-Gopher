The original Go gopher was designed by Renee French. (http://reneefrench.blogspot.com/)

This particular gopher design is a modification of an image created by Takuya Ueda (https://twitter.com/tenntenn):

My version was made in Photoshop, as a proof of concept. I want to make a vector version of it at some point.
